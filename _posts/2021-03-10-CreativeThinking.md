When Computers Defeated Humans… Through Creative Thinking

Decision making is what makes us fundamentally human – or so we’ve always thought. Nowadays, artificial intelligence is rapidly getting better at interpreting complex systems and has managed to beat us in the games and challenges we pride ourselves on mastering.


The 2017 documentary AlphaGo covers Deepmind’s creation of AlphaGo, a Go-playing algorithm intended to defeat top human professionals. Go is an ancient Chinese board game that has significantly more computational complexity than chess. With the help of commentary from Go professionals and software engineers working on the project, the movie takes us through an emotional journey where we switch between rooting for humanity and technology. The first professional match AlphaGo participated in was against the European Champion Fan Hui, which was won by a staggering margin of 5-0. No other computer program had ever defeated any professional without a handicap. Rather than accepting this moment as a triumph for technology, the closed-minded public ridiculed Fan Hui, saying that he was significantly worse than the professionals in Asia. Deepmind then challenged Lee Seedol, the strongest Go player, who believed he would easily win 5-0 or 4-1. His confidence proved to be misguided as he lost 4-1, apologizing in a press conference for not being smart enough. Humanity had to watch as their representative was simply not up to the task. We lost in a battle of creativity and ingenuity, two qualities that we uniquely attribute to humans. 


The story of AlphaGo shows us the all too common human superiority complex that prevents us from acknowledging when we may be outmatched. From climate change to politics, we see this resistance to change in all major modern topics. If Go masters, who dedicated their lives to the game, can accept that there is room for their knowledge to grow and change the way they think, then we should have the capacity to rethink our antiquated mindsets when it comes to global issues. 


Ke Jie, a professional Go player of the highest rank, said after playing an updated version AlphaGo “After humanity spent thousands of years improving our tactics, computers tell us that humans are completely wrong... I would go as far as to say not a single human has touched the edge of the truth of Go.” He then studied the opening strategies of the programs and went on a 22 game win streak against humans. When we embrace computers as sources of new knowledge, we will be able to exceed the previous limitations of humanity.
