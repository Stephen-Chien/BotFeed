This past summer I attended a two week virtual STEM course at NYUâ€™s Tandon School of Engineering. This course focused on IoT (internet of things) and connected devices. We learned about circuitry through the Arduino board and we practiced interfacing with the cloud with Adafruit.io. This great website allowed us to connect our arduino circuit designs with our C++ code and interface with real world appliances such as light bulbs, temperature sensors, humidity detector, motors, etc. Half of the time was spent on creating elegant code, building our arduino circuit designs, and combining the two to form our IoT systems, and the other half was a lecture based college level class. The professor taught us about circuit diagrams, MISO/MOSI, SPI, and a host of other topics related to the theme of connected devices. At the end of the course we designed our own custom weather stations that pulled information from the web and displayed it on our mini touch screen devices. We used an arduino ESP featerwing with the TFT touchscreen to display images, information, text, and allow the user to interact with the system and have the code react to their finger placements.
