Without a doubt, the Covid-19 pandemic has created many obstacles and inconveniences in our lives, within the past year. This virus has caused a severe loss of human life, including many people that are significant to us. (Approximately 2.58 million people have died from Covid.) Covid has also presented us with many different economic and social challenges. For instance, 1.6 billion workers have been placed in immediate danger of losing their jobs. This shockingly high figure accounts for half of the workforce, which consists of workers that are part of the "informal economy." The informal economy comprises of migrant workers and people who hold unstable, manual labor jobs. These workers/individuals are the most vulnerable, since many of them don't have access to quality health care. Furthermore, millions of enterprises and businesses have been shut down to minimize financial loss. The lack of customers, combined with operational costs, has made it very difficult for businesses to thrive during this period. Many more devastating effects of Covid could be stated, although it is not necessary to include them in this article.  

The Role of Robots During This Pandemic 

During this pandemic, the use of robots in hospitals around the globe has greatly increased. Hospital managers have found that there are more benefits of using robots, compared to a traditional hospital employee. The main benefit of using robots is that they present a smaller safety concern. Robots are able to be easily disinfected after coming into contact with patients, and they don't ever get sick. To add on, robots have many different purposes for the hospitals they work for. They are able to monitor covid patients, sanitize the facilities, and help to reduce medical workers' exposure to the virus. These are necessary tasks which must be completed, in order to ensure the safety of these hospitals. 

The use of robots in hospitals is demonstrated through their implementation at a medical center in Kigali, Rwanda. At this medical center, robots are equipped with thermal cameras that record the temperatures of patients. These robots remove the need for medical personnel to come into close contact with the patients, eliminating the possibility of Covid transmission. 

Conclusion

Robots are a necessary element in the fight against Covid-19. Their implementation in hospitals around the world has created many safety benefits, and allowed for hospitals to work more efficiently. I am expecting more robots to be employed at hospitals in the near-future, since they have many more benefits that hospital workers don't.
