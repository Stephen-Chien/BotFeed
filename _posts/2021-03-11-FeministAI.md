Feminist AI

Artificial Intelligence: The Past and Present
In the first half of the 20th century, the world became familiar with the idea that would eventually evolve into artificial intelligence (AI) through the “heartless” Tinman from the Wizard of Oz to a humanoid robot that impersonated Maria in Metropolis. By the 1950s arose a generation of scientists, mathematicians, and philosophers that began to realize the viability and application of AI in the real world. One of the most prominent of that group was a young British polymath named Alan Turing. His question “Can machines think?,” conceptualized in his 1950 paper Computing Machinery and Intelligence, laid the groundwork for the field of AI. Five years later, the idea of AI was initialized through Allen Newell, Cliff Shaw, and Herbert Simon’s presentation of Logic Theorist, a program designed to mimic the problem-solving skills of a human, at a conference called Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence. While the conference failed to agree on standard methods of the field, top researchers from various STEM fields in attendance did manage to coin the term “artificial intelligence” and agree that AI was achievable. 

Now, artificial intelligence is defined as a branch of computer science that endeavors to create machines that can replicate or simulate human intelligence. AI  is categorized into three different types given its capacity to mimic human characteristics.

Artificial Narrow Intelligence 
Artificial narrow intelligence is the only AI that humans have fully realized to date. Narrow AI is designed to perform singular tasks—i.e. facial recognition, speech recognition, driving a car, or searching the internet—and is very intelligent at completing the specific task it is programmed to do. Narrow AI doesn’t mimic or replicate human intelligence, it merely simulates human behavior based on a narrow range of parameters and contexts. 

Artificial General Intelligence 
Artificial general intelligence also referred to as strong or deep AI, is the concept of a machine with general intelligence that mimics human intelligence and/or behaviors, with the ability to learn and apply its intelligence to solve any problem. AGI can think, understand, and act in a way that is indistinguishable from that of a human in any given situation. However, researchers haven’t been able to make a machine conscious and, therefore, have yet to achieve strong AI. The immense challenge of artificial general intelligence is not surprising given that the human brain is the model for creating this form of intelligence, and researchers still struggle with replicating basic functions of sight and movement. 

Artificial Superintelligence 
Artificial superintelligence is a purely hypothetical form of AI that doesn’t just mimic or understand human intelligence but becomes fully self-aware and surpasses the capacity for human intelligence and ability. The potential of having machines like this is exciting, but the concept itself has many unknown, inconceivable consequences. The impact of superintelligent beings on humanity and our survival is pure speculation. 


Artificial Intelligence: The Problem
The most pressing problem with artificial intelligence in our present is its continued negative impact in being discriminatory on the basis of race and gender, most prominently, but also ethnicity and sexuality. While the giants of AI — such as Google, Facebook, and IBM — try to simultaneously balance commercial interest with ethics, efforts to balance the two have undoubtedly failed institutionally and in practice. We need a new field of AI solely constructed to not just combat discriminatory systems but that will reimagine the application of AI. Artificial intelligence isn’t just a product to consumer software; it has a further potential to be used as a tool to fight for racial and gender equity.

Feminist AI: Theory
As technology begins to embed itself further into humanity, gender relations can be thought of as materialized in technology, and masculinity and femininity, in turn, acquire their meaning and character through the enrolment and embeddedness in working machines. The repetitiveness of current AI systems mirrors Butler’s work on gender performativity, which theorizes how gender is constituted in a temporal repetition; it is an action that requires a repeated performance, and “this repetition is at once a re-enactment and re-experiencing of meanings already socially established.” Alan Turing’s 1950 paper, Computing Machinery and Intelligence mentioned above as the founding intellectual work for AI, argues that a computer works according to the principles of imitation but is also able to learn new things. Similarly, gender is also learned, imitative behavior that can be processed so well that it comes to look natural. With these parallels in place, certain AI technologies act to control identity, more specifically gender within a binary framework.

Feminist AI: Practice
Currently, there are three notable AI systems, or aspects of systems, that this new field could address.
Facial recognition technology
Automated facial recognition is probably the most pressing of the three as it purports to identify someone’s gender by analyzing photographs of them. This technology runs off of a gender and race recognition algorithm. Through its reliance on fixed notions of gender and race as common systems, this technology is inevitably discriminatory. Further, computer scientists Timnit Gebru and Joy Buolamwini demonstrate embedded discrimination within these systems with Gender Shades. They find that darker-skinned females were the most misclassified group with an error rate of up to 34.7%. In contrast, lighter-skinned males had a maximum error rate of 0.8%. Additionally, most facial recognition software explicitly dismisses the existence of non-binary genders by only classifying people as either “man” or “woman.” While this technology relies on racial and gender stereotypes to function, it is the future. First, we need to make automated facial recognition tech accurate for all human beings, and second, we could use create new facial recognition technology to equalize non-binary representation by widening the spectrum of recognizable genders. This would not only impact those who identify as non-binary but would also push the destruction of the harmful gender binary into our future.
2. Humanoid robotics
The body is a site that can be inscribed with physiological gender norms and stereotypes. Butler’s work advocates that on the surface of the body, “acts and gestures, articulated and enacted desires create the illusion of an interior and organizing gender core.” In other words, the body is normalized to be consistent with the meaning of what it is to be “male” or “female.” Humanoid robots abide by these structures as they tend to produce and reinforce gendered bodies and behaviors. Further, voices, appearances, and mannerisms, movements, and demeanors that robots employ imitate gender stereotypes present in society. Consider Sophia, the humanoid robot developed by Hanson Robotics, also holds an incredibly lifelike resemblance to a stereotypical woman. Gendered bodies in robotics, particularly those of women, maintain and reproduce stereotypical appearances. However, I believe that humanoid robots have the potential to change the way in which humans think about and perceive gender. What if we purposely created a humanoid robot that didn’t follow binary gender expectations? If we could produce robots that did not perpetuate feminine and masculine “characteristics,” this technology could validate the experience and existence of non-binary individuals as we look towards the future, otherwise, this lack of representation is exclusionary.
3. Virtual personal assistants (VPAs)
Virtual personal assistants actively facilitate gender stereotypes through the power of language and naming. VPAs reproduce the concept of the female figure as the faithful aid. Without the ability to attain self-determined subjectivity on its own, the VPA is in existence to only support and assist. The feminine voice of the VPA is associated with servitude and power disparity, and this gendering becomes an inadvertent enforcer of power disparities between the genders. In other words, the feminine voice of VPAs, such as Alexa or Siri, promotes “digital domesticity.” Rather than just viewing this as a problem, why don’t we recreate VPAs that are ungendered.
