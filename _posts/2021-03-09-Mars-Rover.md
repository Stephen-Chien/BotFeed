Mars Rover

[1]

On February 18, millions of people watched as the Perseverance Rover, after a long journey from Cape Canaveral, Florida, finally landed on Mars. Its chosen landing site was the Jezero Crater, a place which it is theorized was once filled with water. The goal of the mission is to search for signs of ancient life on Mars, and it hopefully can be found at the bottom of this long-dry oasis. The rover will search through areas where water was present. Perseverance is duly equipped for its job, sporting devices for collecting and storing soil samples (and possibly fossils), along with wide-angle cameras and even a small drone called the Ingenuity.
It was launched using the Atlas V-541, a powerful rocket used in both the Curiosity and Insight missions, two previous missions whose rovers are both dead. Soon after launch the rover was separated from the rocket, and continued to travel towards Mars at a speed of 24,600 miles per hour. Even after Perseverance was launched, engineers needed to check in constantly to make sure onboard systems were working properly, keeping antennas pointing towards Earth, and making sure solar panels powering the craft were facing the sun. Many times during the trip, navigation corrections were made to make sure that it stayed on track. In the final 45 days, the rover was prepared for EDL, or Entry, Descent, and Landing.
The technology attatched the rover is just as interesting as the technology and engineering used to build it. In addition to the previously mentioned Ingenuity, a prototype device that can convert CO2 into oxygen.
	
The Perseverance rover has four science objectives: [2]
Searching for habitability
Identify past environments capable of supporting microbial life
Seeking biosignatures
Seek signs of possible past microbial life in those habitable environments, particularly in specific rock types known to preserve signs over time.
Catching samples
Find and collect promising samples of Martian rock and soil which can be brought back to Earth in the future.
Prepare for humans
Test technologies which would help to support future human life.


	The hope is that the Perseverance Rover will lend more to our knowledge and deepen our understanding of the Red planet’s geological, climatological, and meteorological history. The rover’s mission is set to last one Martian year (two Earth years), although theoretically the rover could remain in operation for a decade or more.
