## Columbia University Experience

By the end of my freshman year, having signed up for several coding camps, I was ready to code. Robotics had inspired me to learn as many coding languages as I could, so I signed up for was Code Sleep Repeat at Columbia University. I first heard about the camp through a school-wide email that promoted it. Code Sleep Repeat is a one week, intensive camp that involves learning Swift: a programming language developed by Apple to create iOS apps on iPhone, iPad, and Mac. The program was held at Columbia University. 

Upon arriving at the camp, I was greeted by my main instructor, Cody, and two other assistant instructors. I was also glad to see Erin, a fellow member of my robotics team, 7890. The first and second day involved introductions to coding in general, as well as the basics of Swift. On the third day, we created a drawing app that allowed us to use different tools to draw angles of brushes. This experience was very rewarding, as it was the first time that I had built an app by myself. In addition to learning Swift, we also learned ways to improve our public speaking. We did a variety of icebreakers to introduce ourselves, trying to memorize the names of every single person and their hobbies during the first day. Though I was scared to speak in front of others when I was on the stage, I felt that my anxiety had steadily decreased. I think the experience of speaking to others really helped me throughout school. On day four, we were tasked with building a messenger app. I found this task especially difficult, although I persevered. I wound up customizing my app with widgets and logos, using code to create something I could call my own. The last day of the camp involved making a PowerPoint with an app idea. We presented to the counselors and fellow students, and these presentations provided us the opportunity to learn from others.

Also, I participated in other summer camps at Columbia, including Columbia HSP, Columbia’s High School Program. The courses I took were Introduction to Java, a two-week course all about Java, and Introduction to C. While we were learning Java, our instructor taught us the basics of code (arrays, variables, etc.). It was interesting to see Java from an outside perspective rather than within robotics. I was able to get a more complete view of the language. At the end of the two-week course, we had to do a presentation on a topic of our choice. I chose AI and Machine Learning. 

The final course I took was C, the language Java was built on. The course was much harder than Introduction to Java, as we had to code in Terminal using Vim, which took a while to learn, as there were a lot of commands to memorize. I overcame that boundary through repeated practice of the command line. In the Introduction to C course, we built Tic-Tac-Toe and Connect 4 programs using 2D Arrays. Both of those took one day each and were extremely hard to design. However, I felt accomplished at the end, and I will definitely remember my experiences through Columbia’s summer programs.  Learning app development, C, and Java will certainly benefit me throughout robotics and coding in general. I was also able to improve my speaking skills, which will help me throughout school and future endeavors.
